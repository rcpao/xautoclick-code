v0.20 is released. <P>
If v0.19 worked correctly for you, there's no need to
upgrade. The only things changed are various typos and a little more verbose
output of configure in case none of the needed development packages are
installed. This confused a lot of new users, hence the update.
<P>
If it does not work for you, please file a bugreport on the mailinglist.
Contrary to what some seem to believe, this project is not abandoned. It's just
that the current code seems to work correctly and I never get any bugreports or
feature requests :)
