DESCRIPTION
       This  application enables you to automatically click the left mousebut-
       ton.  It is designed to reduce strain on the wrist  muscles  caused  by
       repetitive  mouse  clicking, which can lead to serious injury or impair
       (RSI, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, et cetera).  By specifying the  interval,
       a random factor and the number of times to click, the program simulates
       natural clicking.

GUI
       This section applies to all GUI versions, but, obviously,  not  to  the
       command line version.  For the command line version, see below.

       The GUI consists of several spinboxes and buttons.  The parameters have
       the following meaning: (all times are in milliseconds)

       pre-delay
              the time the application waits before it starts  clicking  after
              you have clicked start.

       interval
              the time the application waits between two clicks.

       random +/-
              for each click, the application adds or substracts a random fac-
              tor between zero and this value to/from the interval time.

       number of clicks
              the number of times the apllication clicks.

       You can also use the tap button to  click  a  rythm.   The  application
       tries  to  determine  the  correct  parameters  to  mimic that clicking
       behaviour.  Click the start button to start.  While it is  running  you
       can  click  stop  to  stop the clicking before it reaches the number of
       clicks specified.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
       These options only apply to  the  command  line  version  (cautoclick).
       They are ignored by all GUI versions.

       --help display help and exit
       -h
       -help

       -i value
              specify  the  interval,  which  is  the  time  between two mouse
              clicks.  The time is specified in milliseconds (default:  1000).

       -n value
              specify  the  number  of mouse clicks.  The time is specified in
              milliseconds (default: 32).

       -p value
              specify the pre-delay, which is the time the  application  waits
              before  it  starts clicking.  The time is specified in millisec-
              onds (default: 2000).

       -r value
              specify a random factor.  For every click, a random time between
              0  and  this  value  is added to or subtracted from the interval
              time.  The time is specified in milliseconds (default: 0).
